At the heart of the CMake Packaging Project is the CMakePP language. The CMakePP
language is an object-oriented extension to the CMake language written entirely
using the original CMake language. That said, CMakePP has different coding
practices, paradigms, and standards than the native CMake language, much in the
same way that C++ coding differs from C coding despite some level of
interoperability. This documentation is primarily meant to introduce users to
the CMakePP language. Also included are algorithmic details and developer notes,
which may be of some interest to the more advanced users.
