This section provides some helpful information for users who want to get
started using CMakePP. If you are unfamiliar with the CMake language, it is probably best to start with
:ref:`Prerequisite CMake Fundamentals`. If you have a solid grasp of the CMake
language, start by :ref:`Obtaining CMakePP` and then move on to
:ref:`Basic CMakePP Examples` to learn the basics of CMakePP objects and
:ref:`Realistic Usage` to learn how to use CMakePP to simplify your build
system.
