This part provides some helpful information for users who want to get started
using CMakePPCore. If you are unfamiliar with the CMake language, it is
probably best to start with ref:`Prerequisite CMake Fundamentals`. If you have
a solid grasp of the CMake language, start by Obtaining CMakePP and then move on
to Basic CMakePPCore Examples to learn the basics of using CMakePPCore.
