This part provides some helpful information for users who want to get started
using CMakePPCore. If you are unfamiliar with the CMake language, it is best to
start with Prerequisite CMake Fundamentals. If you have a solid grasp of the
CMake language, start by Obtaining CMakePP and then move on to CMakePP Examples
to learn the basics of using CMakePPCore.
