Basic CMakePP Examples
######################

This section provides usage examples of CMakePP classes and maps. These examples
assume you have already set up your build system to download and include
CMakePP automatically. If you have not done this step, please refer to
:ref:`Automatically Download and Include CMakePP`. These examples also assume
you have a basic knowledge of the CMake language. If you need a refresher,
you can refer to :ref:`Prerequisite CMake Fundamentals`.
